Broader access to online content[[cite something]] combined with and increased diversity of available content[[cite something]] has lead to a saturation of internet traffic. This issue has been mitigated through changes in how content is delivered, these changes include more intelligent delivery approaches such as using content delivery networks (CDN)\cite{farber2003internet} and Adaptive BitRate (ABR) streaming \cite{brueck2010apparatus}. These improvements go hand in hand with a need for improvements in quality of experience prediction relative to encoding parameters. 

This paper aims at finding correlation between predicted quality and user ratings based on three different encoding parameters:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Resolution ranging from 540p to 4k
	\item Bitrate ranging from sheisstotal to tomuch
	\item 7he m4g1c p4r4m3t3r
\end{itemize}

Several data has been collected in addition to user ratings, these data include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Feedback questions
	\item Behavior during subjective tests
	\item other?
\end{itemize}
