TODO: shorten

Online video accounts for a large amount of the Internet traffic. To adapt better to changing bandwidth requirements more and more content distributors employ HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS), however specific quality measures are not yet generally available. This paper aims at linking predicted quality and subjective user ratings based on the \textit{VMAF} metric and an \textit{ACR}-style experiment. We analyze encodings of six different 10-second sequences at varying resolutions up to \textit{UHD-1}, with three bitrates per resolution, and compare them with ratings from the perceptual test based on two different encoding presets (a "na\"{\i}ve" approach and an "expert" one). We could accurately predict our final subjective quality results using the \textit{VMAF} metric. Our aggressive optimization with the "expert" encoding preset saves bits and preserves quality at higher bitrates, but leads to visual quality degradation for low bitrates.
