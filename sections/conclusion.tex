\subsubsection{Conclusion}
We found that we can predict the be accurately predicted using the \textit{VMAF} metric.
Our aggressive optimization approach with the "expert" encoding preset pays off at higher bitrates but degrades visual quality for low bitrates. This suggests that high-effort multi-pass encodings like ours mainly benefit high resolution content at large bitrates, where the absolute gain can also be larger.


\subsubsection{Future Work}
Improvements of the automation framework: The source Preparation step could directly transcode the original material to a constant framerate and color-subsampling in a lossless format to avoid a further preprocessing step for the VMAF metrics.

%A longer test or a sectioned test with more participants would provide a better sampling of the bitrate-MOS space and allow for more detailed analysis.

A similar experiment could be done with a specific focus on content-specific encoding approaches like \cite{cock:2016:titleencode}.
