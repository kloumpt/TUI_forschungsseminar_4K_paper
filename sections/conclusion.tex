MOS is quite alot like VMAF (who would have guessed)


"Expert" Preset is not using available bitrate in critical low-bitrate situations. (Drop-Off for 1080p MOS), can already be predicted from VMAF plot.


\subsubsection{Future Work}
Improvements of the automation framework: The source Preparation step could directly transcode the original material to a constant framerate and color-subsampling in a lossless format to avoid a further preprocessing step for the VMAF metrics.\\

A longer test or a sectioned test with more participants could provide a better sampling of the bitrate-MOS space and allow for more detailed analysis.\\

The "expert" preset could be chosen
