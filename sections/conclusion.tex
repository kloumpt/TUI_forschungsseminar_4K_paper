\subsubsection{Conclusion}
The final subjective quality can be accurately predicted using the \textit{VMAF} metric.
Our aggressive optimization approach with the "expert" encoding preset pays off at higher bitrates but degrades visual quality for low bitrates. This suggests that high-effort multi-pass encodings mainly benefit high resolution content at large bitrates, where the absolute gain can also be larger.


\subsubsection{Future Work}
Improvements of the automation framework: The source Preparation step could directly transcode the original material to a constant framerate and color-subsampling in a lossless format to avoid a further preprocessing step for the VMAF metrics.

A longer test or a sectioned test with more participants would provide a better sampling of the bitrate-MOS space and allow for more detailed analysis.

The test could be done to specifically look at content-specific encoding approaches like \cite{cock:2016:titleencode}.
