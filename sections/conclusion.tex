Improvements of the automation framework: The source Preparation step could directly transcode the original material to a constant framerate and color-subsampling in a lossless format to avoid a further preprocessing step for the VMAF metrics.

A longer test or a sectioned test with more participants could provide a better sampling of the bitrate-MOS space and allow for more detailed analysis.
